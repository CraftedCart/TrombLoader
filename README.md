## Installation
If your game isn't modded with BepinEx, DO THAT FIRST! Simply go to the [latest BepinEx release](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/latest) and extract BepinEx_x64_VERSION.zip directly into your game's folder, then run the game once to install BepinEx properly.

Next, navigate to the [Releases](https://github.com/NyxTheShield/TrombLoader/releases) tab, and under the "assets" section, download `TrombLoader.dll` and put it into your game's `BepInEx/plugins` folder.

After this, a "CustomSongs" folder will be created inside the BepInEx folder. Custom charts folders can be placed in this folder, uncompressed.
